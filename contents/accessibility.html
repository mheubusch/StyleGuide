<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>Like localization, accessibility is an important aspect of Firefox copy creation. Similarly, writing well for the web – short sentences, clear hierarchy, non-ambiguous language – supports accessibility efforts. Additional considerations include the use of descriptive and meaningful alt text. You can <a href= “https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/“>learn more from the World Wide Web Consortium</a> about design standards for users who rely on assistive technologies.</p>
<p>It is also important to be fair and respectful when we talk about all Firefox users, regardless of how they use our products to access the Web. Read <a href=“https://adata.org/factsheet/ADANN-writing">advice from the ADA Nation Network</a> on removing bias in accessibility language.</p>
