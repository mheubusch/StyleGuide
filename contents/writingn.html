<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Words are important. If you look closely, you’ll see that Firefox has a lot of words. You might look past most of them most of the time, but when you need to change a setting, retrieve a password, or update an add-on, the words really matter.</p>
<p>We think the words in Firefox should help people get things done, with no confusion and minimal interruption. But we also know they influence how people think and feel about Firefox. When you write for Firefox, you can help people accomplish their goals and feel good about using our products by considering the varied needs of our many users and our communication goals.</p>
